MIalDeal is a website developed to showcase a fictional project/app, MealDeal. Its purpose would be to connect users and education institutions, allowing the former to buy meals from the latter, based on food leftovers from the day. All this would happen at a discounted price, and the user would be able to pick up the meal at a short time past the closing hours of the institution, helping to reduce food waste.

*Part of the final assignment for my Management and Inovations course in university.*
